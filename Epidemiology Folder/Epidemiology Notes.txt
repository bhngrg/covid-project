Epidemiological Models

1) Disease Spreading Agent: Virus
2) Transmission occurs through person -> person, and person -> environment
						     environment -> person

3) For those who recover from COVID-19, new research shows immunity to the 
   virus can last for at least 5-7 months, and may last much longer.

Model Criteria:
- Susceptible class: S(t)
- Infective class: I(t)
- Removed class: R(t)


Assumptions (for greater details click the link above and go to the Section labeled "Assumptions and Notation":

1) Constant population size N, which is large enough so that the sizes of each class 
   can be considered as continuous variables. Other factors are taken into account if you include vital dynamics.
2) Population is homogeneously mixing.
3) More assumptions, read the section.

We need:

COVID-19:
Transmission Rate R_0: (each person infects 2 to 4 people) (assume Normal Distribution and make random vector) *gamma 
(SARS-CoV-2 (causes COVID-19)	1.5 to 3.5)

1/Infection time (sigma): Infection time is 24 days (https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus#:~:text=Most%20people%20with%20coronavirus%20who,there%20are%20documented%20exceptions.)
(harvard health said infecious for 10 days after symptoms resolve)
1/Recovery time (gamma) : Recovery time is 14 days for mild cases, and 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease

We find that those aged under 20 years are roughly half as susceptible to infection as those over 20 years of age

Influenza:

R_0: Seasonal Influenza	0.9 to 2.1
(Source: https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2020posts/how-scientists-quantify-outbreaks.html   <---- This site has a really nice table of R_0 values)

Infection time: People with flu are most contagious in the first 3-4 days after their illness begins.
Some otherwise healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick.
(Source: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/keyfacts.htm )

Recovery time: Symptoms usually appear from one to four days after exposure to the virus, and they last five to seven days. 
For people who've had a flu shot, the symptoms may last a shorter amount of time, or be less severe.

SARS:
R_0: SARS	<1 to 2.75 (umich source with table)
Infection time: 2 weeks (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/faq.html)
Recovery time: 90 day (https://respiratory-research.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1465-9921-6-42)
death rate: 774/8098 (https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html)
Exposure rate: 5 (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-do-sars-and-mers-compare-with-covid-19#SARS)

Immunity: 3 years (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/)
