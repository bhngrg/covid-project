Removed pop group

Susceptible group = old susceptible group + (Removed pop group from # infected at t-182)
	If t-182 is negative, t-182 == 0

REmoved group = Removed + new removed - old removed
	old removed = removed group - (t-182 as before)

probability of dying pop # for normal causes
	for time t, binomial(n = pop size, p = .00888) = number of ppl that could die 
	subtract from each group - susceptible, infected, removed
		susceptible pop/total pop * # die = number that die from susceptible pop

propability of new birth adding to pop size
	for time t, binomial(n = pop size, p = .01199) = number of ppl that could die 
	subtract from each group - susceptible, infected, removed
		susceptible pop/total pop * # die = number that die from susceptible pop
