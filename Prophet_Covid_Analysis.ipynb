    "# Introduction to Time Series Forecasting with Seasonality\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal data analysis, the order of observations that are collected is usally irrelevant. However, most of the data collected in the real world has a certain order built into it. This structure can be exploited for better prediction ability by employing a Time Series Model. The first step in analyzing a time series model is identify and understand the built-in structure of the data over time. These underlying patterns can be classified into four distinct categories:\n",
    "* Trend - Long term pattern in the data (easiest to identify).\n",
    "* Seasonality - Short term patterns that occur within the overall time structure, and repeat indefinitely. \n",
    "* Cyclical Component - Long term oscillations (big waves) within the overall time structure.\n",
    "* Noise(Error) - Random changes occuring in the overall time structure (unlikely to be repeated).\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](./Time_Series_Example_Image.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is to check the underlying assumptions:\n",
    "* Stationarity - This means that the series are normally distributed and the mean and variance are constant over a long time period.\n",
    "* Uncorrelated Random Error - We assume that the error term is randomly distributed and the mean and variance are constant over a time period.\n",
    "* No outliers - This one is self-explanatory.\n",
    "* Random shocks - If shocks are present, they are assumed to be randomly distributed with a mean of 0 and a constant variance."
